Java,What is the difference between constructor and method?,"Constructor is a special member of a class which is used to create the objects to the class. It is special because it will have same name as class. It will have no return type.

Method is ordinary member of a class which is used to implement some behavior of a class. It will have it’s own name and return type.",9

Computer Networks,What is ICMP?,"ICMP is Internet Control Message Protocol, a network layer protocol of the TCP/IP suite used by hosts and gateways to send notification of datagram problems back to the sender. It uses the echo test / reply to test whether a destination is reachable and responding. It also handles both control and error messages.",285
Computer Networks,What is mesh network?,A network in which there are multiple network links between computers to provide multiple paths for data to travel.,286
Computer Networks,What is difference between baseband and broadband transmission?,"In a baseband transmission, the entire bandwidth of the cable is consumed by a single signal. In broadband transmission, signals are sent on multiple frequencies, allowing multiple signals to be sent simultaneously.",287
Computer Networks,What is logical link control?,"One of two sublayers of the data link layer of OSI reference model, as defined by the IEEE 802 standard. This sublayer is responsible for maintaining the link between computers when they are sending data across the physical network connection.",288
Computer Networks,What is virtual channel?,"Virtual channel is normally a connection from one source to one destination, although multicast connections are also permitted. The other name for virtual channel is virtual circuit.",289
Computer Networks,What is packet filter?,Packet filter is a standard router equipped with some extra functionality. The extra functionality allows every incoming or outgoing packet to be inspected. Packets meeting some criterion are forwarded normally. Those that fail the test are dropped.,290
Computer Networks,Expand IDEA.,IDEA stands for International Data Encryption Algorithm.,291
Computer Networks,What is Proxy ARP?,"It is using a router to answer ARP requests. This will be done when the originating host believes that a destination is local, when in fact is lies beyond router.",292
Computer Networks,What is SLIP (Serial Line Interface Protocol)?,It is a very simple protocol used for transmission of IP datagrams across a serial line.,293
Computer Networks,What is RIP (Routing Information Protocol)?,It is a simple protocol used to exchange information between the routers.,294
Computer Networks,What is source route?,It is a sequence of IP addresses identifying the route a datagram must follow. A source route may optionally be included in an IP datagram header.,295
Computer Networks,What is BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)?,It is a protocol used to advertise the set of networks that can be reached with in an autonomous system. BGP enables this information to be shared with the autonomous system. This is newer than EGP (Exterior Gateway Protocol).,296
Computer Networks,What is Gateway-to-Gateway protocol?,It is a protocol formerly used to exchange routing information between Internet core routers.,297
Computer Networks,What is NVT (Network Virtual Terminal)?,It is a set of rules defining a very simple virtual terminal interaction. The NVT is used in the start of a Telnet session.,298
Computer Networks,What is a Multi-homed Host?,It is a host that has a multiple network interfaces and that requires multiple IP addresses is called as a Multi-homed Host.,299
Computer Networks,What is Kerberos?,It is an authentication service developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Kerberos uses encryption to prevent intruders from discovering passwords and gaining unauthorized access to files.,300
Computer Networks,What is OSPF?,"It is an Internet routing protocol that scales well, can route traffic along multiple paths, and uses knowledge of an Internet's topology to make accurate routing decisions.",301
Computer Networks,What is wide-mouth frog?,Wide-mouth frog is the simplest known key distribution center (KDC) authentication protocol.,302
Computer Networks,What is Mail Gateway?,It is a system that performs a protocol translation between different electronic mail delivery protocols.,303
Computer Networks,What is IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol)?,It is any routing protocol used within an autonomous system.,304
Computer Networks,Why should you care about the OSI Reference Model?,It provides a framework for discussing network operations and design.,305
Computer Networks,What is the difference between routable and non- routable protocols?,"Routable protocols can work with a router and can be used to build large networks. Non-Routable protocols are designed to work on small, local networks and cannot be used with a router.",306
Computer Networks,What are the important topologies for networks?,"BUS topology: In this each computer is directly connected to primary network cable in a single line.
Advantages: Inexpensive, easy to install, simple to understand, easy to extend.
STAR topology: In this all computers are connected using a central hub.
Advantages: Can be inexpensive, easy to install and reconfigure and easy to trouble shoot physical problems.
RING topology: In this all computers are connected in loop. Advantages: All computers have equal access to network media, installation can be simple, and signal does not degrade as much as in other topologies because each computer regenerates it.",307
Computer Networks,Difference between bit rate and baud rate.,"Bit rate is the number of bits transmitted during one second whereas baud rate refers to the number of signal units per second that are required to represent those bits. 
  baud rate = (bit rate / N) 
  where N is no-of-bits represented by each signal shift.",308
Computer Networks,"What is terminal emulation, in which layer it comes?",Telnet is also called as terminal emulation. It belongs to application layer.,309
Computer Networks,What is a peer-peer process?,The processes on each machine that communicate at a given layer are called peer-peer process.,310
Computer Networks,When a switch is said to be congested?,"It is possible that a switch receives packets faster than the shared link can accommodate and stores in its memory, for an extended period of time, then the switch will eventually run out of buffer space, and some packets will have to be dropped and in this state is said to congested state.",311
Computer Networks,What is VRC?,"It is the most common and least expensive mechanism for Error Detection. In VRC, a parity bit is added to every data unit so that the total number of 1s becomes even for even parity. It can detect all single-bit errors. It can detect burst errors only if the total number of errors in each data unit is odd.",312
